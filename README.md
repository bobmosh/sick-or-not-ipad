## Project details
This project was created during the #wirvsvirus hackathon.
The goal is to create an iPad app for data overview and analysis. The submission can be found [right here.](https://devpost.com/software/wirvsvirushackathon)

This app could be used by government officials to drive data anlysis forward and manage the data in times of a virus spread similar to the one experienced with the covid-19 pandemic.

## Current state
The current state of teh app depicts merely a proof-of-concept and gives an insight into what could be possible with teh help of digitalisation of managment processes on government side. It can easily be expanded upon.
